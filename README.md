# toddler-typer

This project is made with the sole purpose of creating a safe website for kids to use that has no ads and no significant tracking. There are no accounts, no ads, no micro-transactions, and no database. Everything is client side. New feature requests will be vetted by my kids and bug fixes will probably take me a while to get to, but pull requests will prioritized.
